Onion Scanner is a simple TOR Domain scanner.  It has the ability to
scan .onion domains from a list (with one domain per line) or,
if no list is provided, it will scan all the links provided by
Yet Another Tor Directory (YATD).

The documentation and program itself are still in infancy, please
check back soon for more updates.
